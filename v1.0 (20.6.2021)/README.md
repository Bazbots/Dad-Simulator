# Back story
## Celebrating Father's Day, I decided to make this in C++, which I could have probably done much quicker in Python
## It is a quick console game that is basically just I/O
# Information
## The Achievements.txt stores all achievements (Don't write to it unless you want to cheat)
## Dad Simulator 1.0 (20.6.2021).exe is the actual game and it runs in the console
## If you have any troubles, join [this](https://discord.gg/Sun4mtFjwE) server and DM Baz for more information!
# Thanks for reading and enjoy!
